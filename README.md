### error boundary

See example in `src/App.tsx`.

Error boundaries are a way to wrap portions of an application and prevent runtime errors from bubbling up higher in the React components tree so we handle those errors and update the UI and/or send some alerts accordingly. They require class components. Wrapping components with an error boundary is as easy as using `React.Fragment` for instance.

### Provider

See example in `src/AuthProvider.tsx`.
